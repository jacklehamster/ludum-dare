PARAMETERS and MULTIPLAYER:
At the start of the game, a javascript function will get called: function notify(id). It will send out the id used to connect for multiplayer.
On the demo site, notify is defined to alert(id).

Another player who wants to connect to that game will need to pass that id into parameter "peer"

Here are the javascript functions called from the flash:
notify(id) => passes out the peerID, so that we can use javascript to save it for game lobby or other things.
gameOver(mywin) => called when the game is finished between two players.

To pass parameters to flash,

    *     use "file.swf?param1=XXX&param2=XXX"
    *     or use the tag: <Param name="FlashVars" Value="param1=XXX&param2=XXX">.

The second option is better.

Here's the list of parameters:

    * peer: pass peer=id to connect to a player that started a game with that id.
    * playsolo: (for demo purposes only). pass playsolo=1 to play single player
    * MAXPLAYTIME: overrides the default time of 60sec of a player to make a move before the skip / remove button appears.
    * ROOM: by default, it's just "room". It's the room where the two players are. It's also the channel that cirrus connects to.
    * pic1: URL to the picture of the first player. This replaces the 1st picture placeholder.
    * playername: Name of the first player.
    * pic2: This replaces the 2nd picture placeholder. Note that this will get replaced by the profile picture of the second player once he connects, so use this parameter to load a default placeholder image for profile pictures.
    * picbg: URL to the picture of the background.
    * stick: URL to the picture of the stick.
    * debug: pass debug=1 to display the game settings like wallfriction, ballfriction...
    * skin: Base name for ball pictures. if you set skin=ball, the ball images will be replaced by ball0.jpg, ball1.jpg, ball2.jpg... ball15.jpg
    * fps: for performance testing. Pass fps=1 to show frames per second.

For a player entering a room, the picbg and skin parameter will get replaced by the settings of the player in that room. However, each player retains their own sticks.

I've setup the demo site so you can pass parameters to the flash from the URL:
